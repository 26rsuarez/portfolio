# Personal Portfollio     

Deployed [here](https://26rsuarez.github.io/portfolio)

# Description

My portfolio shows some of the projects that I have worked on. You can also download my resume, get contact information and access my social media links. I used a template because I liked the style and user friendly way to edit the code.
